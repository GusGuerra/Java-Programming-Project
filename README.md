This is a simple clicker game I like to call "Bacon Baker". It's pretty much a budget "Cookie Clicker".
I mainly used javax.swing and java.awt, as these were the main tools we learned about during the classes.
The game is not supposed to have deep meaning or mechanics. Just click the bacon in the middle of the screen and start gaining points. It's pretty nice if you want to speed run against someone on a simple game.
